# Clubs

If you are applying for higher education, like med school, law school, or PhD, it may make sense to want to have some sort of clubs to demonstrate you were active in school and you helped the community and you have leadership skills etc.
Otherwise, it's really up to interest.
Some people are tryhards and want to continue their high school legacy and be president of every club they can.
Some people just want to eat pizza with some friends.
College has a lot of people, and a lot of people with interests. So it's up to you to find your calling. You can stretch your boundaries, and try new things. But, like mentioned in [friends](friends.md), you don't want to force it.

There are "exclusive" clubs. Frats may fall in that category, maybe business/med clubs. At the end of the day, it's not really _that_ big of a deal. If your family is already wealthy and powerful, joining a club is probably not going to bolster that. If your family is not that, then joining an "exclusive" club is not going to raise you to the elite ranks either.
