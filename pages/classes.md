# Classes to take

> If there is _anything_ to get out of this, **please get good grades**.

Yada yada grades don't matter. Yeah but you know when grades matter most? When you are applying to internships, and especially when you are looking for your first job.
While it's true your GPA and what classes you took matter less in mid-career, are you even in a career? No.
Also, even though it's not necessarily true that having a good grade in a class implies you got the most out of it (counterexamples: you already knew the content, the standards for the class were low anyway, etc.), it's still a pretty good measure.
At the very least, it shows you tried, and you have some semblance of competitive spirit, which is important for most things in the real world, jobs aside.

While this may all sound like parent-talk, the point is, if _you don't know what you're doing_, you should just work hard to get good grades. The risk of messing up your future prospects with bad academic performance is too high for not just meeting a baseline GPA. This is similar to investing, where most people should invest in the S&P500 if they don't know what they are doing. Yet people are still deluded in thinking they can beat the market and lose tons of money trying to. There is some truth to the slow and steady winning the race in the long term.
