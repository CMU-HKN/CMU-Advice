# Friends

> Show me your closest friends and I'll show you your future

There are people in your life that have potential to influence you. Family is one, and friends is another.
The reason friends influence you is, you spend a lot of time with them, and usually to maintain friendships, you start acting like them or _with_ them.

## You can't really force it

You may see the quote, and start thinking big. Ok, let me think about my dream friend group: attractive, smart, successful, wealthy. 
But, remember friends are mutual, right? There will be natural separation of people in social groups based on the status quo.
You are more likely to hang out with people that either complement your personality, or are similar to you.
You can work your way up to those fanciful ideal groups, but that's not really the point of friends, right.
If it comes organically, that is ok.
And, let's say you do want those things. There are 2 ways to achieve it:
- Choose friends that are _already_ attractive, smart, successful, wealthy
- Choose friends that will _become_ these attributes

If you want to be a Mean Girl but don't wear Pink on Wednesdays, the latter makes a lot more sense, and you will probably see less issues.

Some friends are temporary, and _that's ok_. The notoriously emphemeral friend group is the partying one.
Think about this, partying is already a high energy activity. Like top sports player, being a hardcore partyer is not something you can maintain for a long time, unles you devote your entire life to it. If you want to be the Lebron James of partying, go for it. But most people will drop out for various reasons. Maybe they find a girl, maybe they are just tired. Maybe they get bored, things aren't as fun as they used to be. etc. etc.

## The boomer advice

If you have the chance to talk to someone in their mid 30s, an observation they will likely tell you is that maintaining friends becomes harder and harder. As you age, you naturally have more responsibilities, and less free time.
So what they told me is, if people don't want to hang out with you, don't take it personally. And the reciprocate is that if you reject someone's hangout request, you shouldn't feel bad about it. Don't hold it as a grudge. 
And if you happen to see each other again, just treat it like a blessing. A lucky happening. 
Unless you _really_ don't like that person. But even then, life goes on.

## What if I have no friends?

Ok so there are the jokes about "oh I have no friends," but if you're seriously asking about it and struggling to find friends, here are a few things to think about [1].

- If you think of friendship as something very transactional, people hang out because it gives mutual benefit. So, again like dating, what do you bring to the table?
- If you are negative all the time or an unpleasant person, then people will not want to hang out with you
- Unpleasant can mean a lot of things. You could be dressing poorly, have bad hygiene, act weird etc.
- Acting weird...what does that mean. If you are able to read people's faces, and you notice people always give you "weird looks," it is a good idea to evaluate your actions and double check if there are behaviors you show that are weird.
